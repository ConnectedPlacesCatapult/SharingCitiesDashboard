[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/350323c0db166acb5049b26ec2330f42/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/350323c0db166acb5049b26ec2330f42)

Sharing Cities Analytics API allow the users of the Sharing Cities Dashboard to perform analytics on datasets. Currently, only time series forecasting over historical measurements is supported. In the future, this could be extended to include [Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression), [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) and [Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification). 

## Time Series Forecasting
A time series is a set of oredered measurements collected over time. In the context of Sharing Cities, this includes data sourced through the API sensor importers. Examples include air quality measurements for a particular attribute, availability of parking spots etc. Time Series Forecasting is a set of methods that allow extrapolation of time series values in the future by relating the present values of a time series to past values. At the moment, Sharing Cities only support univariate time series forecasting. 

Compared to an ordinary set of measurements, time series may include the following additional characteristic:

- Trend (tendency of the measurements to increase or decrease over time)
- Seasonality (the tendency of measurements to repeat periodically over time)
- Long-run cycle (any period unrelated to seasonality)
- Stationarity (the statistical properties of the time series such as mean, variance etc. remain constant)

From the multitude of forecasting methodologies/engines, Sharing Cities uses [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)'s forecasting engine to generate predictions. Prophet's modelling framework uses the same principles of additive [Holt-Winters ](https://otexts.org/fpp2/holt-winters.html)(exponential smoothing) seasonal method, decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal and cycle components and approximating these using non-linear functions. 

Advantages of Prophet's engine over traditional time series methods such as [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) for this particular application are the following:

- Approaching time forecasting as a curve fitting problem allows more flexibility to forecasting a wider range of time series specifications. For Sharing Cities this is of particular importance since the API data output can be very different in terms of data types, temporal frequency etc.
- Prophet's engine abstracts many analytical/preprocessing layers required to achieve quality results from the end user. 
- Prophet's model specification allows fast fitting processes, a very important attribute for dashboard based applications.

## Preprocessing steps
A time series generated by APIs is not always temporally consistent. This is due to a variety of factors, ranging from sourcing update frequency to sensor specifications. Forecasting greatly benefits from a time series with a regular temporal frequency. Thus, there is a need to regularise the series by imputing the temporal frequency window. This step attempts to infer the temporal frequency using the Pandas library. In the case of irregularly sampled values, the time series is resampled to hourly intervals and the resulting missing values filled with the mean value of all vaues in the resamping window. More missing value techniques could be implemented in the future. 

## Requirements

- Postgresql
- Git
- Python 3

To setup the API locally, please see the requirement.txt for packages required to run the API \
Do a pip install on the requirements.txt

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The API should be called using POST and passing in request parameters are JSON.

## Installation Guide
- [Windows]() - Coming soon
- [Mac]() - Coming soon
- [Ubuntu]() - Coming soon

### Parameters

- columnsX(Dependent Variables):
    - It is a mandatory field
    - Requires a dictionary with table names as keys and column names as dictionary
    - With in column name filters can be provided currently we are only 
    supporting **_and** and **_or** filter.
- columnY(Independent Variable):
    - It is a mandatory field
    - Requires a string mentioning the column name
- tableY:
    - It is a mandatory field
    - Requires a string representing the table name of columnY
- operation:
    - It is a mandatory field
    - Requires a string representing what user would like to do with data e.g user could pass 'regression', 'classification', 'clustering' any other value would result in an error.
- requestor_id:
    - It is a mandatory field
    - It is the user id of the user initiating the task
- timeseries:
    - A mandatory field
    - It is a boolean value representing whether it is a timeseries request.
- missingValues:
    - A mandatory field
    - It helps user define an operation that would be performed in case of a missing value from the dataset e.g if user chooses to pass 'mean' then the missing values in the dataset would be replaced by the mean of the column. Valid options are:
        - Remove
        - Mean
        - Median
        - Default (a user passed value)
        - Forward Fill
        - Backward Fill
- dataRange:
    - Not a mandatory field
    - User can specify the date range from which data can ve choosen. e.g to specify choose data between 1st July 2018 to 1st September 2018, user can pass '01-07-2018 00:00:00 . 01-09-2018 00:00:00'. The date on the left side of the dot operator is 'from date' and date on the right side of the dot operator is 'to date'.

## Example Query

```bash

			"_and": ["no2", "so2"]
		},
		"col2": "None" ,
		"col3": "None"
	},
	"table2": {
		"col4": "None",
		"col5": "None",
		"col6": "None"
	}
},
"columnY": "ycola",
"tableY": "table3",
"operation": "classification",
"requestor_id": 456,

"missingValues": "mean",
"dataRangeFrom": "12-03-2018 00:00:00",
"dataRangeTo": "14-03-2018 00:00:00"
}

```

## Example Response in case of successful response

```bash

{
    "status": {
        "message": "Request Accepted",
        "id": 8,
        "user": 456,
        "timestamp": "04-10-2018 15:37:11"
    }
}

```

## Example Response in case of error

```bash
Suppose we didn't pass what needs to be done with missing values

{
    "message": {
        "missingValues": "Provide what needs to be done with missing values"
    }
}

```
